    "Hello, and welcome to my github repository. This repo has been created in order to satify the work required to complete the Programming for Data Analysis course - which is a key part to my completion of the HDip in Computer Science with Data Analytics at the Atlantic Technological University. This repository contains two main bodies of work - the 'Assignment 1' folder that I have compiled throughout the course, which is my dissection of global Video game sales.\n",
